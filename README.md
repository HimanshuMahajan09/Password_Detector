# Password Breach Detector (Bloom Filter)

> Fast, memory-efficient tool that checks whether a password *may* have appeared in a known breached-password dataset using a Bloom Filter.

---

## Overview

This project builds a lightweight password breach detector that answers the question: Has this password likely appeared in a breached dataset? It uses a Bloom Filter for space-efficient probabilistic membership testing. The detector will never guarantee a password isn't breached (false negatives are impossible with correct construction), but it may report false positives (i.e., say "MAYBE breached" when it's not present).

## Key Features

* Extremely memory-efficient membership checks using a Bloom Filter
* Quick lookups suitable for embedding in web services or offline tools
* Simple CLI / web entrypoint (app.py) to test passwords

## How it works (short)

A Bloom Filter is a bit array plus multiple hash functions. To insert a password we hash it with multiple functions and set bits at the resulting indices. To test membership, we hash the password the same way and check whether all those bits are set. If any bit is unset, the password is definitely *not* in the set. If all are set, the password *may* be in the set (possible false positive).

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows (PowerShell)


2. Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the app:

bash
python app.py


Depending on app.py the project may start a small web server or provide a CLI — follow prompts in terminal.

## Usage examples

### CLI-style (example)

bash
$ python app.py --check "password123"
Result: MAYBE Breached (probable match in bloom filter)


### Web-style (example)

If app.py runs a Flask app, open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and submit a password in the UI (if present).

## Adding breached datasets

1. Place a newline-separated list of breached passwords in data/breached.txt (or update path used by code).
2. Run the script / helper that builds the Bloom Filter from this file (look for a file like build_bloom.py or src functions).
3. Persist the Bloom Filter bit-array to disk (if implemented) so the app can load it at startup.

*Important:* Do not commit raw breached password lists to public repos. Keep any real breached datasets private and encrypted if required.

## Tuning & accuracy

* m (size of bit array) and k (hash functions) determine false positive rate. Choose based on expected dataset size n and acceptable false positive probability p.
* Theoretical values: m = -(n * ln p) / (ln 2)^2 and k = (m/n) * ln 2.

## Security & Privacy

* This tool is for *research and local testing*. Never use leaked password lists irresponsibly.
* When checking *real user* passwords, avoid logging or transmitting them in plaintext. Consider hashing client-side and sending only the hash prefix (k-Anonymity pattern) or using cryptographic approaches like SQL-like pwned-passwords APIs.

## Development notes

* Check src/ for Bloom Filter and hashing implementation. Look for: multiple independent hashes, bit-array implementation (Python bitarray or bytearray), and serialization helpers.
* Add unit tests to validate false-positive rate and correctness.

## Dependencies

See requirements.txt for the exact packages. Typical dependencies might include:

* Flask (if app is web-based)
* bitarray (or similar efficient bitset)
* pytest (for tests)

## Contribution

Contributions, bug reports and pull requests are welcome. If you plan to add large breached datasets, do *not* include them directly in the repo; provide a script to download them from a secure source or instructions for maintainers.
